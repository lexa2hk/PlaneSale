# PlaneSale
**Planesale** is a web application representing an aviation ticket sales company. All of the planes are based at OMS airport, where all taxiways, parking spaces, and takeoff lines have been implemented.

The **backend** of the application is built using Spring Web, PostgresSQL for database management, and JWT authorization for authentication. 

The **frontend** is developed using React and has a separate repository. 

The application's **API** is tested using Postman.

This project was developed as a coursework for the 4th semester of the Bachelor's program in Programming Engineering at RTU MIREA.
